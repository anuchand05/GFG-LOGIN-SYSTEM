# GFG---Django-Login-System.
A GFG Login System typically refers to a login and registration system implemented as part of a coding project or tutorial, often inspired by GeeksforGeeks (GFG) examples. This system allows users to create an account, log in securely, and manage authentication features. Below is a brief overview:

Key Features
User Registration:

Users provide details like username, email,  and password.
Passwords are encrypted using hashing algorithms like bcrypt.
User Login:

Users input their credentials (email/username and password).
The system validates credentials against the database.
Session Management: 

After successful login, sessions or tokens (e.g., JWT) are generated for maintaining user authentication.
Security Measures:

Password hashing for secure storage.
Validation checks to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
Database Integration:

User details are stored in a database (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB).
Frontend Interface:

User-friendly forms for login  and registration, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Backend Logic:

Backend frameworks like Node.js, Flask, or Django handle routing, validation, and database interactions.
